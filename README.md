# Ultra Fast Prime Assestment (UFPA)

This algorithm provieds the fastest way to check if a number is prime or generate a list of prime numbers.

I have made this using a magic hack of only one line to check prime number.\
This algorithm is made from my theory that if a number can't be divided by 2,3,5,7 than no number in infinity can divide that number.

Time Complexity for this algorithm is:
  - O(1) for checking a number.
  - O(n) for genrating prime numbers upto 'n'
